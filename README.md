# llm-knowledge-search
This project enables natural language queries to retrieve relevant nodes and relationships from a graph graph database populated by the llm-extraction-from-artifacts pipeline. It aims to build intelligent agents that can interpret user questions, understand graph context, and return meaningful insights from the knowledge base.
